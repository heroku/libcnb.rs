# Test Buildpacks

Buildpacks in this directory are meant as integration tests for libcnb.rs. In some cases, unit tests are not enough to
verify the correctness of the framework. Don't use these buildpacks as examples on how to implement a buildpack, see
the [`examples` directory](../examples) instead.
