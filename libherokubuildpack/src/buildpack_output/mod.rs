//! # Buildpack output
//!
//! Use [`BuildpackOutput`] to output structured text as a buildpack executes. The buildpack output
//! is intended to be read by the application user running your buildpack against their application.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use libherokubuildpack::buildpack_output::BuildpackOutput;
//!
//! let mut output = BuildpackOutput::new(std::io::stdout())
//!     .start("Example Buildpack")
//!     .warning("No Gemfile.lock found");
//!
//! output = output
//!     .section("Ruby version")
//!     .finish();
//!
//! output.finish();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Colors
//!
//! In nature, colors and contrasts are used to emphasize differences and danger. [`BuildpackOutput`]
//! utilizes common ANSI escape characters to highlight what's important and deemphasize what's not.
//! The output experience is designed from the ground up to be streamed to a user's terminal correctly.
//!
//! ## Consistent indentation and newlines
//!
//! Help your users focus on what's happening, not on inconsistent formatting. The [`BuildpackOutput`]
//! is a consuming, stateful design. That means you can use Rust's powerful type system to ensure
//! only the output you expect, in the style you want, is emitted to the screen. See the documentation
//! in the [`state`] module for more information.
