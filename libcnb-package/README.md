# libcnb-package &emsp; [![Docs]][docs.rs] [![Latest Version]][crates.io] [![MSRV]][install-rust]

A library for cross-compiling and packaging buildpacks written with [libcnb.rs](https://github.com/heroku/libcnb.rs).

This is an internal crate and should not be used by users directly. There are no stability guarantees for its API.

In most cases you should use [libcnb-cargo](https://crates.io/crates/libcnb-cargo) and/or
[libcnb-test](https://crates.io/crates/libcnb-test), rather than depending on this crate
directly.
