# Rust learning resources

Everyone's learning journey is different. The following resources are presented to give you an overview of the landscape. Pick the ones that speak to your learning journey.

## Book

Rust has many concepts that will be new to many programmers. It's helpful to start with a book that covers it in depth.

- Read [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
- Read [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)

## Interactive learning

While doing the book, it's recommended you practice your skills.

- Rustlings is an interactive tutorial. It presents you with a code puzzle designed to highlight language syntax and features. Solve the puzzle to advance [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).

Developers found that engaging with Rustlings earlier yielded better results.

## Library books

Many popular libraries maintain their mdbook with detailed guides on how to use them. If a library you use often has one, these are worth reading or skimming to reference. For example, [the cargo book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).

## Learn via reading Rust code

- List of [algorithms and implementation of them in Rust](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Rust)

Several contributors participated in the yearly "Advent of Code". Many people provide their answers in the open when they're done. For example:

- https://github.com/edmorley/advent-of-code-2021
- https://github.com/schneems/advent_2021

## Concepts

### Errors

Errors can be difficult to grasp, but they are worth learning.

- [Error handling in libraries versus applications](https://mmapped.blog/posts/12-rust-error-handling.html).
- [Error handling in Rust](https://blog.burntsushi.net/rust-error-handling/). Includes a history of Rust's `try` operator and lots of insight into working with errors. It pairs well with an article on [when using unwrap() in Rust is okay](https://blog.burntsushi.net/unwrap/).
- [errors in rust: a deep dive](https://www.halcyon.hr/posts/error-handling-in-rust/)

### Style

- [Common newbie mistakes and bad practices](https://adventures.michaelfbryan.com/posts/rust-best-practices/bad-habits/). It lists several patterns to avoid and what you should use instead. It is not crucial, but it will help you produce happier code.

### Performance

- [Rust performance book](https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/introduction.html). Not critical for most things done in the libcnb/scripting context, but worth linking.
