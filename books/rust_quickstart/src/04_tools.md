# Tools

## Cheatsheets

- Common [struct conversions cheetsheet](https://upsuper.github.io/rust-cheatsheet/?dark,large). Uses the standard shorthand notation like `map ((T) -> U) -> Option<U>` to demonstrate how to convert from one struct to another (using the common types: `Option`, `Iterator<_>`, `Result<_,_>` etc.).
- Rust [language cheatsheet](https://cheats.rs/). A very comprehensive kitchen sink reference to different Rust syntaxes and concepts.

## Finding libraries to use

- [lib.rs](https://lib.rs/)
- [Blessed.rs](https://blessed.rs/crates)
- [Awesome Rust](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust)
- [crates.io](https://crates.io/)

## Regex creation

-  https://regex101.com/ (choose PCRE). You'll have to manually escape your values, as Rust does not have a native regex syntax.

## Rust playground

You can write and execute code in the browser at rust playground https://play.rust-lang.org/. This tool is commonly used for sharing code snippets. If you're encountering a problem you would like help with, providing an executable example of the problem when asking for help (for example, on Stack Overflow) can help improve your results.
