# Introduction - What is this book exactly?

Learning Rust isn't easy, but it's worth it. This book is not a comprehensive tutorial or resource for that process, but it serves as a living document for those coming to Rust for the first time, specifically to work with making buildpacks through libcnb.

## History

Understanding the content of this document can help to understand the history of how we collected this information.

In 2020 Manuel and Terence Lee began working on libcnb.rs. At the time, the existing buildpacks on the Heroku Languages team were written in either bash or ruby. As the team made the formal decision to move forward with Rust as a programming language, we also had to figure out how to get everyone up to speed on a new language.

We collected informal notes designed to help each other quickly get up to speed on Rust. These were kept internal to the team. As the project is more mature and we anticipate new developers coming to the project without Rust experience, we are sharing these notes publically as an mdbook to keep the docs fresh and help others.
